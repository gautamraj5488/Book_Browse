  - Data is loaded incrementally to enhance performance and minimize wait times.
- **Caching with Flutter Cache Manager:** 
  - Utilizes caching to store books' data, reducing the number of API calls.
  - If cached data is available, it is displayed to the user, improving app load times.
  - Refreshes data from the API when necessary, ensuring content stays up to date.
